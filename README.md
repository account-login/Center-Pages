If you use a wide screen, you may have encountered websites that are too wide to be pleasant read with endlessly long lines or websites which align to the very left side of your screen so close to the border that it hurts. For such websites you can use *page-aligner*. *page-aligner* simply adds a margin to the sides, which you can increase/decrease via two buttons. Just have a look at the animated gif.
