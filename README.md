# Center-Pages Browser Extension

<img src="page_aligner_animation.gif" alt="animated gif" />

If you use a wide screen, you may have encountered websites with long endless lines across the whole width of your screen or websites which align to the very left side of your screen so close to the border that it hurts. For such websites you can use *Center Pages*. *Center-Pages* simply adds a margin to the sides, which you can increase/decrease via two buttons. Just have a look at the animated gif above.

### Disclaimer:

Center-Pages does NOT track any information and does NOT inject anything into the page besides the frame that pushes the page to the center of your screen. The extension needs access to the page content, in order to create the frame; there is no other way to accomplish this.
